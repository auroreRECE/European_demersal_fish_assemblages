## Workflow

The analysis pipeline follows these steps:

1.  Blabla
2.  Blabla
3.  Blabla
4.  Blabla


## Content

This repository is structured as follow:


- [`data/`](https://github.com/auroreRECE/European_demersal_fish_assemblages/tree/main/data):
  contains a sampled of data used in the article. The folder is split in
  two folders:
  [`data/raw/`](https://github.com/auroreRECE/European_demersal_fish_assemblages/main/data/raw)
  to find a sample of all raw data (acoustic, eddy trajectories, chloro
  and sst) ; and
  [`data/intermediate/`](https://github.com/auroreRECE/European_demersal_fish_assemblages/tree/main/data/intermediate)
  with some intermediate .Rdata files, to make easily the Figures.

- [`figures/`](https://github.com/auroreRECE/European_demersal_fish_assemblages/tree/main/figures):
  contains the figures used to validate et visualize the outputs.

- [`scripts/`](https://github.com/auroreRECE/European_demersal_fish_assemblages/tree/main/scripts):
  contains R scripts to run the workflow. The order to run these scripts
  is explained in each name of files and follow the Workflow
  description.
